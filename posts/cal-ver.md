  ![Comic](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9hs03jei042my4bqaox1.jpeg)

## Oi!
    - From New year resolutions to what smartphone we own _(this year)_. There is only one constant in the global namespace. ‚è∞ `Time`. that ticks us off like epoch dates.

## What is the point?
    - The Love of Zero
      -  `git init`
      - ![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/nmj4g0c6bp72hgiv8kbw.png)<br />Hearts break. And so does code.
    - Zero Ver
    - The Death of Tex
    - Many have no point. Apple, HTML, 
## _"We'll do it in PHASE 2.0"_ üëÄ
    - Has become a graveyard for unrequested features
    - What ever happened to Web 3.0?
    - Did you really see a difference when Apple version bumped OSX from 10.15 to 11.0? Or did you have more important things going on at home than what problems were in Big Sur? (did we get 10x the increase?)
## ...But what about SemVer?
     - The Emperor has no clothes
     - **MUST** be auto incrementing
     - Continuous Integration Steps
## A brand new **_DD_ ay**...A brand new **_YYYY_ ear**
      - Here is some logic for you. _"`if` **SemVer** is for better communication, `then` why do we speak to each other like a `SPACE-X‚Ñ¢` satellite when we make changes to our code?"_. Honest question...
      - Nothing _wrong_ with **SemVer**. Be more **Sem**antic in our **Ver**sioning.
      - [Naming things is hard. Versioning even harder.
      - Never Forget [_"I Just Liberated My Modules"](https://kodfabrik.com/journal/i-ve-just-liberated-my-modules) Because one person can still take down the whole interwebz.
    - **DD** Daily Deadlines _(No Crystal Balls)_
       - A strict posting schedule is totally rad. It forces us to break out of too many ideas and build **SOMETHING**! What we build may not be perfect. But it will be the best idea we had at that moment`.js` in time.
    - **MM** Monthly Moshpits
    - **WW** Minor Threats _(In My Eyes...THIS IS FINE!)_
      - _(N/A)_ Divisible by 2 AND 4.
      - 2 min. punk song.
      - {% youtube mOf6w59jz_g %}
    - **YYYY** Annual Festivals
  - **Ubuntu**: African Humanity as a System _(AHaaS if you will)_
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy
    - [Ubuntu told by Nelson Mandela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HED4h00xPPA)
  - New Year resolution.
    - What if we can create software without dragging developers through our release cycles? Whether you live life on the edge of `latest`, or prefer a more `stable` point in history. Maybe they are both correct. The grocery store has used **CalVer** for centuries. Would this improve **D**eveloper e**X**perience? 'Could be right...'Could be wrong...but at least we will be [**On Time** ‚è∞ with the rest of the world](https://www.news.com.au/technology/why-do-americans-put-the-date-the-wrong-way-around/news-story/2623ac4a756a5948df44c0233ea8b4a9).
