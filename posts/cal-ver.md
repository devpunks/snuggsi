# `SemVer` is sooo `20.2.0` üò±

## Oi!
    - From New year resolutions to what smartphone we own _(this year)_. There is only one constant in the global namespace. ‚è∞ `Time`. that ticks us off like epoch dates.

## What is the point?
    - The Love of Zero
      -  `git init`
    - Zero Ver
    - The Death of Tex
    - Many have no point. Apple, HTML, 
## _"We'll do it in PHASE 2.0"_ üëÄ
    - Has become a graveyard for unrequested features
    - What ever happened to Web 3.0?
## ...But what about SemVer?
     - The Emperor has no clothes
     - **MUST** be auto incrementing
     - Continuous Integration Steps
     - Facce it. **SemVer**
## A brand new **_DD_ ay**...A brand new **_YYYY_ ear**
    - **Ubuntu**: African Humanity as a System _(AHaaS if you will)_
      - {% wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy %}
      - {% youtube HED4h00xPPA %}
      - Here is some logic for you. _"`if` **SemVer** is for better communication, `then` why do we speak to each other like a `SPACE-X‚Ñ¢` satellite when we make changes to our code?"_. Honest question...
      - Nothing _wrong_ with **SemVer**. Be more **Sem**antic in our **Ver**sioning.
      - [Naming things is hard. Versioning even harder](https://kodfabrik.com/journal/i-ve-just-liberated-my-modules)
    - **DD** Daily Headbang _(No Crystal Balls)_
    - **MM** Monthly Moshpits
    - **WW** Minor Threats _(In My Eyes...THIS IS FINE!)_
      - _(N/A)_ Divisible by 2 AND 4.
      - 2 min. punk song.
      - {% youtube mOf6w59jz_g %}
    - **YYYY** Annual Festivals
  - New Year resolution. Could be right...Could be wrong...but at least we will be [**On Time** ‚è∞ with the rest of the world](https://www.news.com.au/technology/why-do-americans-put-the-date-the-wrong-way-around/news-story/2623ac4a756a5948df44c0233ea8b4a9).
